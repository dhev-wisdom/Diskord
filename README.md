<!-- FUTURE FEATURES -->

## 🔭 Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

> User Account Recovery: Implement a "Forgot Password" feature that allows users to reset their passwords in case they forget them. Users can request a password reset link via email, which will securely verify their identity and allow them to set a new password.

> Enhanced Upload Size Limit: To improve app performance and prevent excessive resource usage, consider implementing a more robust system for limiting the size of file uploads. This ensures that large uploads do not slow down the application, improving overall user experience.

> Mobile App Conversion: Extend the reach of your app by converting it into a mobile application. Developing mobile apps for Android and iOS platforms can help you tap into a broader user base and provide a more convenient and accessible new_feature_1experience
